Operation Einstein is a mission dedicated to make Google Sites embeddable. And I know that this is going to be difficult to complete.
I, XDZIPPER, am going to be dedicated to making the cause of Operation Einstein possible, even if it means getting a team, (hard to get) just suited for this task.
Here are the steps for Operation einstein. Step #1: Find web proxies online. Step #2: Send them to me, (XDZIPPER) where I will do all sorts of testing. Each proxy link will be 
put in a list designed for the tests. If you have any questions about Operation Einstein, email me at officialrbs98@gmail.com  and I will try my best to answer.
